# Learn Artificial Intelligence the easy way


To play off of [Dan Ariely](https://www.facebook.com/dan.ariely/posts/904383595868), **Artificial Intelligence** is a lot like teenage sex. Everybody talks about it. Only some really know how to do it. Everyone thinks everyone else is doing it. So, everyone claims they’re doing it.

Artiﬁcial intelligence is a booming ﬁeld with many real-world applications. Machines are very good in solving problems that are intellectually diﬃcult for human beings to solve - 
problems like any complex mathematical computation. The true challenge to AI instead is to be solve the tasks that are easy for Humans to perform but hard to describe
formally — problems that we solve intuitively, that feel automatic for us, like recognizing spoken words or faces in images.
